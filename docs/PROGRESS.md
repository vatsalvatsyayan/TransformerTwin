## Current Status: 🟢 Session 18 Complete — QA Analysis + 8 Bug Fixes

### Session 18 Additions (2026-03-22)

**Context**: Ran full Playwright QA across all 14 feature areas (see `docs/analysis.md`). Found 4 bugs during live testing (BUG-001→004), plus addressed all 4 outstanding issues from ISSUES.md (ISSUE-027→030). All 8 items now resolved.

#### BUG-001 Fixed: App crash on first load (SensorRow.tsx)
- `expected != null` guard (was `!== undefined`): backend sends `null` on first tick, not `undefined`. This crashed `null.toFixed(1)` in every render. Now safe.

#### BUG-002 Fixed: FAN_BANK/OIL_PUMP showed raw sensor IDs (constants.ts)
- Added SENSOR_META entries for `FAN_BANK_1`, `FAN_BANK_2`, `OIL_PUMP_1` so labels show "Fan Bank 1" etc.

#### BUG-003 Fixed: OIL_DIELECTRIC LimitBar always at 100% (constants.ts, SensorRow.tsx)
- Added `invertedScale?: boolean` to `SensorMeta`. `OIL_DIELECTRIC` now shows ~0% fill (healthy) for 54 kV and fills toward 100% as voltage approaches 30 kV (critical minimum).

#### BUG-004 Fixed: "−7.4°C above model" for below-model readings (OperatingEnvelopeChart.tsx)
- Made "above/below" direction word dynamic based on deviation sign.

#### ISSUE-027 Fixed: Anomaly alert flood during high-speed operation
- `AnomalyDetector.reset_history()` added — clears rolling baselines + last_status.
- `SimulatorEngine.set_speed()` now calls `anomaly_detector.reset_history()` when speed changes. Forces 20-sample quiet period before any new alerts can fire.

#### ISSUE-028 Fixed: Direction-agnostic recommended actions
- Added `_ANOMALY_RECOMMENDED_ACTIONS_BELOW_MODEL` dict for TOP_OIL_TEMP, BOT_OIL_TEMP, WINDING_TEMP.
- `_emit_anomaly_alert()` selects the below-model actions when `deviation_pct < 0` for thermal sensors.

#### ISSUE-029 Fixed: Snapshot API returns NORMAL for boolean fan/pump sensors
- `GET /api/sensors/snapshot` now maps boolean sensors (where `SENSOR_UNITS[sid] == "boolean"`) to ON/OFF status based on stored float value (≥0.5 → ON, <0.5 → OFF).

#### ISSUE-030 Fixed: Physics Correlation Y-axis fixed at 0–150°C
- `CorrelationChart.tsx` now computes `tempDomain` from actual data range ± 10% padding (rounded to nearest 5°C). Normal operation data (25–45°C) now fills the chart height.

#### Session 18 Log Entry
| 2026-03-22 | 18 | Comprehensive QA (analysis.md) + 8 bug fixes: BUG-001 null-guard crash, BUG-002 FAN/PUMP labels, BUG-003 invertedScale dielectric, BUG-004 above/below phrasing, ISSUE-027 anomaly reset on speed change, ISSUE-028 direction-aware actions, ISSUE-029 snapshot boolean ON/OFF, ISSUE-030 auto-scale correlation Y. 28/28 backend tests pass. |

## Current Status: 🟢 Session 17 Complete — Critical Bug Fixes (Refresh + UI Stability)

### Session 17 Additions (2026-03-21)

**Context**: User reported the app "refreshes" and "can't click many buttons." A deep code analysis identified 5 root-cause bugs; all fixed.

#### Bug Fix: WebSocket Reconnects on Every Playback Toggle (`useWebSocket.ts`)
- **Root cause**: `mode` was in `handleMessage`'s `useCallback` dep array → `connect` was recreated → `useEffect([connect])` re-ran on every LIVE/playback switch, closing and reopening the WebSocket.
- **Fix**: Replaced `const mode = useStore(...)` with a `modeRef` + a syncing `useEffect`. `modeRef.current` is read inside `handleMessage` at call time; `mode` no longer appears in the dep array. `handleMessage` and `connect` are now stable for the lifetime of the component.

#### Bug Fix: StrictMode Double WebSocket Connections (`useWebSocket.ts`)
- **Root cause**: React StrictMode's cleanup+re-run caused the `onclose` handler to fire and schedule a reconnect via a stale `connect_v1` closure. If the new `connect_v2` socket was still CONNECTING, `connect_v1` opened a third parallel connection — causing racing store writes.
- **Fix**: Added `isIntentionalCloseRef` boolean. The cleanup sets it to `true` before calling `ws.close()`. The `onclose` handler returns immediately if the flag is set, skipping the reconnect timer. Also strengthened the guard from `readyState === OPEN` to `readyState === OPEN || readyState === CONNECTING`.

#### Bug Fix: Compact Health Strip — ~142px → ~44px (`HealthBreakdown.tsx`, `TabContainer.tsx`)
- **Root cause**: The always-visible HealthBreakdown had 6 rows × ~22px = ~132px + padding = ~142px. On a 14" MacBook Pro, this left only ~385px for tab content with a fault scenario active.
- **Fix**: Added `compact` prop to `HealthBreakdown`. In compact mode, 6 components render as inline colored-dot chips (`flex-wrap` row) with hover/click behavior preserved. TabContainer now uses `<HealthBreakdown compact />` with a 44px gauge, total strip ~44px. Gain: ~100px more content area.

#### Bug Fix: ScenarioProgressBar No Longer Causes Layout Shift (`ScenarioProgressBar.tsx`)
- **Root cause**: The multi-line block (scenario name row + stage row + progress bar = ~90px) appeared suddenly when a fault scenario started, shifting all content down by 90px mid-interaction.
- **Fix**: Rewritten as a compact single-line strip (~32px): "⚡ [Scenario Name] [mini-bar] [X%]". All info preserved. Layout shift eliminated. Total savings with health strip fix: ~160px more content area on smaller screens.

#### Bug Fix: Playback Slider Max Froze When Entering Playback (`store/index.ts`, `useWebSocket.ts`, `BottomTimeline.tsx`)
- **Root cause**: `simTime` is suppressed in playback mode (sensor_update messages ignored), so the slider `max` froze at the simTime when playback was entered.
- **Fix**: Added `maxAvailableSimTime` to the store (always updated in both live and playback modes via a dedicated `setMaxAvailableSimTime` action). The playback slider now uses this value for its `max` attribute.

#### Session 17 Log Entry
| 2026-03-21 | 17 | Bug fixes: (1) WS mode-dep reconnect — modeRef breaks dep chain; (2) StrictMode double-connect — isIntentionalCloseRef + CONNECTING guard; (3) HealthBreakdown compact prop — 142px → 44px strip; (4) ScenarioProgressBar single-line — 90px → 32px; (5) maxAvailableSimTime for playback slider max. 28/28 backend + 125/125 frontend tests pass. Build clean. |

## Current Status: 🟢 Session 16 Complete — True Digital Twin Paradigm

### Session 16 Additions (2026-03-21)

This session addresses the **fundamental gap between "monitoring dashboard" and "digital twin"**: the model-vs-reality paradigm. Previous sessions had all the visual chrome, but the core DT insight — _what should it read vs what does it read_ — was missing. Now it's the centerpiece.

**Critical Analysis (as digital twin domain expert):**
The previous system's "expected" value in sensor readings used a rolling statistical mean of recent actuals — that is a statistical anomaly detector, not a digital twin. A real DT continuously runs the physics model in parallel and compares: "given load=72%, ambient=28°C, cooling=ONAF, IEC 60076-7 predicts 68°C — actual is 79°C — this +11°C gap is the fault signature." This distinction is what GE SmartSignal and similar platforms are built on.

#### Feature: Physics-Based Model vs. Reality (THE Core DT Change)

**Backend — `simulator/thermal_model.py`:**
- Added `winding_temp_physics: float` field to `ThermalState` dataclass — the IEC 60076-7 prediction without scenario modifier
- `tick()` now returns both `winding_temp` (observed, includes fault delta) and `winding_temp_physics` (pure physics prediction)
- Comment explains the digital-twin significance: "gap = fault signature"

**Backend — `models/schemas.py`:**
- Added `expected_top_oil_temp`, `expected_winding_temp`, `expected_bot_oil_temp` to `TransformerState` (all default 0.0, backward compatible)
- Updated DGA default values to match new config baseline

**Backend — `simulator/engine.py`:**
- `_tick()` now captures expected values from thermal model BEFORE scenario modifiers: `state.expected_*` = IEC 60076-7 prediction
- `_emit_sensor_group()` uses physics-based expected values instead of rolling mean for the `expected` field in WebSocket messages — **this is the paradigm shift**
- Added `_last_scenario_id` tracking to detect scenario transitions
- New `_emit_scenario_start_alert()` method: emits an equipment/operational alert at the START of each scenario (before thermal consequences manifest), making fault causality physically realistic

#### Feature: Realistic Equipment Fault Alarms at Scenario Start
Five scenario-specific startup alerts that fire when a scenario begins:
- `hot_spot`: "Abnormal Winding Temperature Rise Detected — IEC model deviation >10°C"
- `cooling_failure`: "EQUIPMENT ALARM: Cooling Fan Protection Tripped — Overcurrent" (CRITICAL severity)
- `arcing`: "PROTECTION ALERT: Buchholz Relay Pre-Trip Condition"
- `partial_discharge`: "Online Monitor: Partial Discharge Activity Increasing"
- `paper_degradation`: "Insulation Aging Monitor: CO/CO₂ Ratio Declining"

In real SCADA, the equipment event fires FIRST, then thermal consequences follow. This is now correct.

#### Feature: Model-vs-Actual Deviation in SensorRow (`SensorRow.tsx`)
For the three thermal sensors (TOP_OIL_TEMP, WINDING_TEMP, BOT_OIL_TEMP):
- Shows `mdl +11.2°C` badge when deviation ≥ 0.5°C
- Color-coded: grey (< 5°C), yellow (5–10°C), orange (10–15°C), red (≥ 15°C)
- Expandable context line shows "IEC model: 68.0°C · actual: 79.4°C" when deviation ≥ 2°C
- This is the defining digital twin signal — visible in the sensor panel at all times

#### Feature: DGA Rate-to-Threshold (`DGASummary.tsx` — fully rewritten)
- TDCG bar: visual fill with IEEE C57.104 thresholds (720/1920/4630 ppm) marked
- CO₂/CO Ratio: color-coded bar with normal/caution/critical ranges; interpretation text
- Gas concentration table: for each gas, shows current ppm, trend arrow, rate (+X.X ppm/day), and **time-to-next-threshold** at current rate (e.g., "to CAUTION: 4 days")
- Time-to-threshold colored: red = hours, orange < 7 days, yellow < 30 days, slate = safe
- Standards badges: IEEE C57.104, IEC 60599

#### Feature: Operating Envelope Chart (`OperatingEnvelopeChart.tsx` — NEW)
The defining digital twin visualization — Load% vs Top Oil Temperature:
- **Blue curve**: IEC 60076-7 steady-state prediction at current cooling mode (ONAN/ONAF/OFAF)
- **Historical scatter points**: colored by deviation from model (grey=on-model, yellow=+2–5°C, orange=+5–10°C, red=>+10°C fault)
- **Live point**: large dot showing where transformer is RIGHT NOW on the envelope
- **Design limit lines**: CAUTION/WARNING/CRITICAL horizontal reference lines
- **Current operating callout**: shows Load%, Actual, Model, and deviation prominently
- **Explanation tile**: "Why This Matters" — explains the GE SmartSignal paradigm
- Added to Physics tab as the primary sub-tab (Operating Envelope | Temporal Correlation)

#### Feature: Realistic DGA Baseline (config.py + schemas.py)
Updated initial DGA gas levels to represent TRF-001 as a genuine 17-year-old in-service transformer:
- H₂: 15→25 ppm, CH₄: 8→12 ppm, C₂H₆: 12→15 ppm, C₂H₄: 3→4 ppm
- C₂H₂: 0.2→0.5 ppm, CO: 80→120 ppm, CO₂: 600→900 ppm
- CO₂/CO ratio = 7.5 → within normal aging range (5–13 per IEEE C57.104)
- TDCG baseline = 176.5 ppm — well within Level 1 (<720 ppm)

#### Session 16 Log Entry
| 2026-03-21 | 16 | Real DT paradigm: physics model vs. reality in thermal sensors (winding_temp_physics in ThermalState, expected_* in TransformerState, engine captures IEC 60076-7 prediction), scenario-start equipment alarms (5 scenarios), SensorRow model deviation badge, DGASummary rewrite (TDCG bar + CO₂/CO ratio + rate-to-threshold), OperatingEnvelopeChart (Load% vs Temp with IEC model curve + historical scatter + deviation coloring). 28/28 backend + 125/125 frontend tests pass. |

## Current Status: 🟢 Session 15 Complete — Digital Twin Visual & UX Overhaul

### Session 15 Additions (2026-03-21)

This session addresses the five most impactful gaps: **the project looked like a dashboard, not a digital twin.** All changes are frontend-only, additive. 125/125 tests still pass.

**Why these 5?** A visitor couldn't answer: (1) what transformer is this? (2) where is the heat? (3) what happened and when? (4) is this reading abnormal? (5) does the physics actually work? — now they can.

#### Asset KPI Bar (`AssetKPIBar.tsx` — NEW)
Full-width strip between header and 3D viewer:
- Transformer nameplate: TRF-001 | 100 MVA | 220/33 kV | ONAN/ONAF/OFAF | Siemens AG | Bay 3 Substation | Est. 2009
- 5 live KPI tiles: Load Factor (% of rated), Winding Temp (% of 140°C limit), Top Oil Temp (% of 95°C limit), Health Index, Est. Time-to-Critical
- Each tile has a color-coded fill bar (green→yellow→orange→red) and status sub-label
- IEC 60076-7 / IEC 60599 / IEEE C57.104 standard badges — proves domain authenticity

#### Thermal Gradient 3D Model (`Tank.tsx` — REWRITTEN)
The tank body now **visualizes the oil thermal gradient** from bottom to top:
- 5 horizontal slices interpolating BOT_OIL_TEMP (bottom) → TOP_OIL_TEMP (top) emissive colors
- Temp→color: <50°C=no glow | 65°C=amber | 75°C=orange | 85°C=red | 95°C+=critical red
- `lerpEmissive()`: hex-color interpolation for smooth gradient
- Health selection highlight still overrides temperature gradient when active
- This is the defining digital-twin visual: **you can SEE where heat accumulates in the oil column**

#### Animated Oil Circulation (`RadiatorBank.tsx` — ENHANCED)
When FAN_BANK_1, FAN_BANK_2, or OIL_PUMP_1 is ON:
- 7 animated sky-blue particles (one per inter-fin channel) move upward via `useFrame`
- Phase-staggered for realistic non-uniform flow; fade-out near top for seamless loop
- Makes the cooling system VISUALLY ACTIVE — not just a color change

#### Event Timeline Tab (`EventTimeline.tsx` + store + `useWebSocket.ts` — NEW TAB)
Chronological operational log capturing everything that happens during a session:
- Alert events, health drops (≥3pt), scenario stage changes, cascade events, connection events
- Color-coded severity (info/caution/warning/critical) with left border + dot
- Timeline tab shows event count badge; store caps at 300 events
- New: `frontend/src/types/timeline.ts`, `TimelineEvent` in store, `addTimelineEvent` action

#### Sensor Trend + Limit Bars (`SensorRow.tsx` — ENHANCED)
- **Trend arrow**: ↑/→/↓ from last 4 readings; orange when rising+anomalous
- **Limit bar**: 3px fill bar showing value as % of CRITICAL threshold, color-coded by status

#### Physics Correlation Chart (`CorrelationChart.tsx` — NEW TAB "Physics")
Dual Y-axis chart proving IEC 60076-7 thermal physics is working:
- Load% (left, indigo) correlated with Top Oil °C (orange), Winding °C (red), Bot Oil °C (gray dashed) over time
- IEC reference lines: 140°C winding, 95°C top-oil, 100% load limits
- 3 explanation tiles: causal physics, thermal gradient theory, fault signature pattern
- History aligned on sim_time, down-sampled to ≤120 points for performance

#### Session 15 Log Entry
| 2026-03-21 | 15 | Digital twin overhaul: AssetKPIBar (nameplate + 5 KPI tiles), Tank thermal gradient (5-slice BOT→TOP interpolation), RadiatorBank animated oil flow (useFrame particles), EventTimeline tab (alert/health/scenario/cascade events), SensorRow trend+limit bars, CorrelationChart Physics tab (dual Y-axis load vs temps). 125/125 tests, build clean. |

### Session 14 Additions (2026-03-21)

This session adds the "secret sauce" that makes TransformerTwin feel like a real digital twin rather than a monitoring dashboard: **emergent physics, irreversible damage, and predictive capability**.

#### Feature: Automatic Fault Cascade (Thermal→Arcing)
When a fault scenario is running and winding temperature stays at CRITICAL (≥120°C) for more than 5 simulated minutes, the system organically escalates to arcing — without any operator intervention:
- **`backend/config.py`**: Added `CASCADE_ARCING_TRIGGER_S=300.0`, `CASCADE_C2H2_RATE_PPM_PER_S`, `CASCADE_H2_RATE_PPM_PER_S`, `CASCADE_CH4_RATE_PPM_PER_S`, `CASCADE_ARCING_RAMP_S=600.0`
- **`backend/simulator/engine.py`**: Tracks `_winding_critical_duration` per tick; once threshold exceeded, injects escalating C₂H₂+H₂ DGA rates via `dga_mods`; emits one-time CRITICAL alert "CASCADE FAILURE: Thermal→Arcing Escalation"; broadcasts `cascade_triggered`, `cascade_duration_s` in `scenario_update` WebSocket messages
- **Frontend**: `cascadeTriggered` state in store (set via `updateScenario`); `CascadeBanner` in `ScenarioProgressBar.tsx` (red banner at top of tab area); flashing red emergency section in `DecisionPanel.tsx`

#### Feature: Thermal Fatigue Tracking (Irreversible Insulation Aging)
Cumulative degree-hours above 105°C (the insulation onset threshold) that never reset — modeling permanent insulation damage:
- **`backend/config.py`**: Added `FATIGUE_ONSET_THRESHOLD_C=105.0`, `FATIGUE_FULL_DAMAGE_DEGREE_HOURS=1000.0`
- **`backend/simulator/engine.py`**: `_thermal_stress_integral` accumulates `(winding_temp - 105°C) × dt_hr` each tick; exposed as `thermal_fatigue_score` property (0.0–1.0); broadcast in `scenario_update`
- **Frontend**: `thermalFatigueScore` in store; `ThermalFatigueBar` in `PrognosticsWidget.tsx` showing cumulative % with label (Negligible/Low/Moderate/High/Severe) and description

#### Feature: Prognostics Engine — Time-to-Failure Prediction
The system now predicts the future: how long until WARNING and CRITICAL thresholds are breached, and what intervention would buy:
- **`backend/analytics/prognostics.py`** (NEW): `PrognosticsEngine.compute()` runs linear regression on health score history → degradation rate (pts/sim-hr), trend (RAPIDLY_DEGRADING/DEGRADING/STABLE/IMPROVING), time-to-WARNING (health <60), time-to-CRITICAL (health <40), projected health at 24h/48h/72h under no-action and 70%-load intervention
- **`backend/config.py`**: Added `PROGNOSTICS_HISTORY_LEN=100`, `PROGNOSTICS_MIN_HISTORY_POINTS=8`, warning/critical thresholds, horizon, intervention constants
- **`backend/api/routes_prognostics.py`** (NEW): `GET /api/prognostics` endpoint
- **`backend/main.py`**: Registered `routes_prognostics`
- **`frontend/src/types/prognostics.ts`** (NEW): Full TypeScript types for `PrognosticsResponse`, `ThermalFatigue`, `ProjectedHealth`, `InterventionProjection`
- **`frontend/src/lib/api.ts`**: Added `getPrognostics()`
- **`frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts`**: Added `fetchPrognostics()`
- **`frontend/src/store/index.ts`**: Added `prognostics` state + `setPrognostics` action
- **`frontend/src/App.tsx`**: Initial fetch + 5s polling for prognostics

#### Feature: PrognosticsWidget
New `frontend/src/components/panels/PrognosticsWidget.tsx` with:
- Degradation rate display (pts/sim-hr, color-coded by severity)
- Time-to-WARNING and Time-to-CRITICAL countdowns
- 3-column projected health bars (24h/48h/72h) comparing no-action vs 70%-load intervention
- Thermal fatigue progress bar
- Urgency-based border color (red for CRITICAL/EMERGENCY, orange for HIGH, yellow for MEDIUM)
- Embedded in Decision tab between Risk Assessment and Recommended Action

#### Enhancement: FMEACard Evidence Chain Visualization
`frontend/src/components/panels/FMEACard.tsx` rewritten:
- Matched evidence renders as a **visual causal chain** with connecting vertical line, node dots, and sensor value badges
- Unmatched conditions shown dimly below
- Confidence label badge added to header row alongside failure mode ID
- Match score progress bar always visible under the header (red/orange/yellow)
- Affected components rendered as monospace tag badges
- Metadata row (severity + development time) above recommended actions

All tests still pass: 28/28 backend, 125/125 frontend. Frontend TypeScript build clean.

### Session 13 Additions (2026-03-21)

#### Bug Fix: Speed 100×/200× not activating
- Root cause: `SpeedUpdateRequestSchema` had `Field(ge=1, le=60)` — Pydantic rejected 100 and 200
- Fix: changed to `Field(ge=1, le=200)` in `backend/models/schemas.py`
- Also fixed `engine.py` docstring ("1–60" → "1–200")

#### Feature: Health Component → 3D Highlight
Clicking a health component row in HealthBreakdown now highlights the corresponding 3D parts:
- `HealthBreakdown.tsx`: rows are now clickable buttons; selected row shown with cyan ring + sky-blue bar
- `useHealthColor.ts`: when `selectedHealthComponent === key`, returns `{ emissive: '#38bdf8', emissiveIntensity: 1.8 }` (bright cyan override)
- `store/index.ts`: added `selectedHealthComponent: HealthComponentKey | null` + `setSelectedHealthComponent`
- `types/parts.ts`: added `healthKey: 'cooling'` to `fan_1` and `fan_2` entries
- `parts/FanUnit.tsx`: reads `selectedHealthComponent === 'cooling'` from store, overrides ON/OFF color with cyan when selected
- Click the same row again to deselect and clear the 3D highlight
- Mapping: DGA→Buchholz relay, Winding→Tap Changer, Oil Temp→Tank, Cooling→Radiator+Fans+Pump, Oil Quality→Conservator, Bushing→HV+LV Bushings

#### Feature: Operator Control System (the killer demo feature)
Real-time operator interventions that directly affect the physics simulation:

**Backend:**
- `backend/api/routes_operator.py` (NEW): `POST /api/operator/actions`, `GET /api/operator/status`
- `backend/simulator/engine.py`: added `operator_load_override: float | None` + `operator_cooling_override: str | None`
  - `set_operator_load(fraction)` / `set_operator_cooling(mode)` / `clear_operator_overrides()`
  - Applied in `_tick()`: operator overrides take precedence over normal profile and scenario overrides
- `backend/models/schemas.py`: added `OperatorActionRequestSchema`, `OperatorStatusResponseSchema`, `OperatorActionType`
- `backend/main.py`: registered `/api/operator/actions` and `/api/operator/status` routes

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/types/operator.ts` (NEW): `OperatorAction` union type + `OperatorStatus` interface
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`: added `executeOperatorAction()`, `getOperatorStatus()`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts`: added `fetchOperatorStatus()`
- `frontend/src/store/index.ts`: added `operatorStatus`, `setOperatorStatus`
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`: initial fetch + 5s polling for operator status
- `frontend/src/components/panels/DecisionPanel.tsx`: **Operator Controls** section (always shown at top of Decision tab)
  - Load Management: 70% Load / 40% Load / Full Load (toggle buttons, active state shown with checkmark)
  - Cooling Mode: Auto / ONAF / OFAF (toggle buttons)
  - Active overrides: pulsing green banner "Active: Load 70% + ONAF cooling"
  - "Restore Normal" button clears all overrides
  - Immediate feedback message after each action

**Demo sequence**: trigger hot_spot → watch winding temp climb → click "70% Load" + "ONAF" → watch temperatures flatten and recover over ~30 real seconds at 30× speed. This closes the feedback loop and turns the system from passive monitoring to active control.

All tests still pass: 28/28 backend, 125/125 frontend.

### Session 12 Additions (2026-03-21)
- **Speed options expanded**: Now supports 1×, 10×, 30×, 60×, 100×, 200× (was capped at 60×). At 200× you can watch a full 3-hour fault scenario in 54 real seconds.
- **Actionable anomaly alerts**: Every sensor anomaly alert now includes sensor-specific step-by-step recommended actions (9 sensors covered: thermal and all DGA gases). Previously `recommended_actions` was always `[]`.
- **Decision Support System** — the centerpiece real-world use case feature:
  - `backend/analytics/decision_engine.py`: New `DecisionEngine` class computing risk, RUL, economics, and runbooks
  - `backend/api/routes_decision.py`: `GET /api/decision` REST endpoint
  - `backend/config.py`: Economic constants (transformer replacement $3.2M, outage $85k/day, maintenance $12k)
  - `frontend/src/types/decision.ts`: Full TypeScript types for decision response
  - `frontend/src/components/panels/DecisionPanel.tsx`: New tab panel with 4 sections
  - Polling: `fetchDecision()` called on mount + every 5s alongside DGA/FMEA
- **Decision Panel sections**:
  1. **Asset Risk Assessment**: 5-dot visual risk meter (NOMINAL/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL), risk description
  2. **Recommended Action**: Specific action with deadline and business reasoning
  3. **Economic Impact Analysis**: 3-scenario cost table (Act Now ~$16k / Delay 14d ~$220k / Failure ~$3.8M) with potential savings
  4. **Operator Runbooks**: Per-fault step-by-step procedures (8 runbooks for FM-001 through FM-008) with interactive checkboxes, progress bar, and procedure ID
- **Tab indicator**: Decision tab shows orange/yellow dot when risk is MEDIUM or higher

All backend intelligence implemented. Anomaly detection, DGA analysis, FMEA, health score, what-if simulation, and WebSocket wiring all running. 28/28 integration tests passing. 125/125 frontend tests passing.

### Session 11 Additions (2026-03-21)
- **2 new fault scenarios**: Partial Discharge (CH4/H2 → Duval PD zone), Paper Insulation Degradation (CO/CO2 ratio decay)
- **FMEA alert emission**: Engine now emits `FMEA_ENGINE` alerts when confidence escalates (Monitoring→Possible→Probable) with full `recommended_actions` list
- **Richer anomaly descriptions**: Include current value, expected value, deviation %, and trend direction
- **Expandable AlertPanel**: Click any alert to expand description + recommended actions; FMEA alerts get purple badge + colored left border
- **ScenarioProgressBar**: Prominent color-coded strip (yellow→orange→red) above tab content during active fault simulations
- **AlertToast**: Transient CRITICAL/WARNING overlay on 3D viewer with fade-slide animation (5s auto-dismiss)

## Decisions Made
(Move to DECISIONS.md when they accumulate)

- 2026-03-20 Chose Python FastAPI over Next.js for backend — need real WebSocket streaming + NumPy for sensor math
- 2026-03-20 Chose React Three Fiber for 3D — stays in React ecosystem, JSX-based
- 2026-03-20 Chose SQLite over external DB — zero infra, sufficient for single-asset POC
- 2026-03-20 Deterministic fault scenarios with state machines — reproducible demos
- 2026-03-20 Used flat Zustand store (no immer middleware) for simplicity during skeleton phase
- 2026-03-20 Pinned requirements to `>=` ranges for Python 3.13 binary wheel compatibility
- 2026-03-20 Chose IEC 60076-7 exponential lag thermal model (not linear approximation) — more realistic transient behavior, only ~10 lines of code overhead
- 2026-03-20 Chose linear + Arrhenius DGA model (not full Oommen model) — sufficient for POC, calibrated to hit correct Duval zones at scenario peaks

---

## Blockers / Open Questions

- Port 8000 is taken on this machine. Run backend with `--port 8001`. Before Phase 1.6 integration: update `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` and `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` to point to port 8001. See `.env.example`.

Frontend build passes tsc + vite. | Phase 4.7 end-to-end integration test, then Phase 5 polish |
| 2026-03-21 | 6 | Phase 5 complete. Fixed SensorRow status (was hardcoded NORMAL). Added disconnection banner and connecting overlay in App.tsx. Fixed silent API error swallowing. Wrote README.md (full setup, API reference, architecture notes). Wrote docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md (10-min walkthrough, 8 segments, talking points, troubleshooting). 28/28 tests pass, frontend build clean. | Visual QA |
| 2026-03-21 | 7 | Visual QA via Playwright MCP. Ran full 15-section TEST_PLAN.md. Found and fixed: DGA+FMEA never fetched (added REST polling in App.tsx + useApi.ts), FAN_BANK showing "0.0" instead of ON/OFF (SensorRow.tsx), Duval zone labels outside triangle (centroid Y sign bug in DuvalTriangle.tsx), speed button active state not visible (added ring highlight), What-If missing cooling energy row (added card to WhatIfPanel.tsx), FMEA/Alert empty states had no icons (added SVG icons). All fixes verified with screenshots. | Frontend unit tests |

Found and fixed 3 critical bugs: (1) HealthGauge + HealthBreakdown never rendered — added to TabContainer as always-visible strip; (2) anomaly detector min_std floor too small (1e-9) causing 1400+ alert flood — fixed to 1% of sensor range; (3) historical playback snapshot route not registered because backend was started without --reload before route was added — restarted backend. All features now verified: WebSocket, header controls, 3D model, 21 sensors + sparklines, health gauge/breakdown, DGA/Duval Triangle, FMEA, What-If, alerts, hot-spot scenario, arcing scenario, playback scrubber. ADR-019, ADR-020 logged. ISSUE-017, ISSUE-018, ISSUE-019 resolved. | Project fully demo-ready |

| 2026-03-21 | 14 | Fault Cascade + Thermal Fatigue + Prognostics Engine. Engine gains cascade tracking (_winding_critical_duration → injects C₂H₂/H₂ DGA after 5 sim-min CRITICAL), thermal stress integral (_thermal_stress_integral → fatigue_score 0–1). New analytics/prognostics.py: linear regression on health history → degradation rate, time-to-warning/critical, 24h/48h/72h projections. New GET /api/prognostics. New PrognosticsWidget in Decision tab. FMEACard: visual causal evidence chain. ScenarioProgressBar: cascade emergency banner. Frontend build clean. | Digital twin UX overhaul |
| 2026-03-21 | 15 | Digital Twin Core Overhaul (all 5 changes frontend-only). (1) AssetKPIBar: transformer nameplate + 5 live KPI tiles with limit bars.

(2) `expected_top_oil_temp/winding_temp/bot_oil_temp` in TransformerState; engine captures before scenario modifier applies. (3) SensorRow rewrite: IEC model deviation badge (mdl ±X°C) + expandable context line ("IEC model: 68.0°C · actual: 79.4°C") for thermal sensors. (4) DGASummary rewrite: TDCG bar with IEEE C57.104 thresholds, CO₂/CO ratio bar, gas rates with time-to-threshold countdown. (5) OperatingEnvelopeChart (NEW): Load% vs Top Oil scatter + IEC 60076-7 model curve + deviation-colored historical points + CAUTION/WARNING/CRITICAL reference lines. (6) Physics tab now defaults to Operating Envelope sub-tab. (7) Scenario-start equipment alarms (5 scenarios, SCADA-authentic descriptions). (8) DGA baseline → realistic 17-year-old transformer (H2:25, CO:120, CO2:900, CO₂/CO=7.5). 28/28 backend + 125/125 frontend tests pass. |
